*Abstract*
This work aims to pave the way towards applying the self-excited Hawkes model on Twitter
messaging, more concretely on the epidemic process of tweets triggering re-tweets for a
certain topic or hashtag. One of the key ingredients of the Hawkes model is the response
function, i.e. the timing of re-tweets after their original or mother tweet. Due to the
heterogeneity in topics and users a categorization of response functions was conducted
for hashtags of both \endogenous" and \exogenous" single events, like movie releases or
bombings, as well as for phases of extended events, in this work social protests.
The specic kind of re-tweeting (one-click re-tweets) investigated here always refers
back to the most original tweet, allowing one to robustly sample the renormalized mem-
ory kernel. Furthermore, due to the clear denition of original, exogenous mother tweets
and endogenous re-tweets, the branching ratio can be easily calculated. A simple numerical
method to reconstruct the bare memory kernel from the renormalized memory kernel
was developed, which may give insights into the individual as opposed to the collective
human behavior in responding to Twitter content. With the help of synthetic data this
could be used to demonstrate the theoretically predicted anomalous scaling, where a longer
renormalized memory results from a shorter bare memory. Further, the very cause of this
behavior could be empirically conrmed, namely the earlier triggering of events resulting
from a shorter bare kernel.
Having confirmed the methods and metrics on synthetic data, the empirical Twitter
data could be addressed. Generally, a longer memory, could be observed across dierent
hashtags. When a power law could be concluded, the exponent was found to be  = 0:70:1.
The two methods of extracting the power law exponent, namely plotting the Hill estimation
versus the lower bound and a maximum-likelihood estimation combined with Kolmogorov-
Smirnov tests, yielded similar results. Endogenous single events could not be classied
according to a common power low exponent because they are in fact composed of two subclasses:
pre-burst-focussed and after-burst-focussed events. On the contrary, exogenous
single events had a similar exponent of  2 [0:706; 0:749].
For the extended events power law behavior could not be concluded for the individual
phases, though for both of the entire social protests. While predicting real-life-criticality
by means of the branching ratio turns out to be very cumbersome, the rst protest (#Ferguson)
could be classied as a protest dominated by an initially triggering exo-burst with
diminishing self-excitation, the second protest (#OccupyCentral) as a well-maintained and
centrally organized protest with constant criticality across all phases.
The results of this work show that a larger-scale analysis with more hashtags is necessary
in order to more robustly determine hashtag classes and response functions and thus be
able to calibrate the Hawkes model on Twitter data for a higher predictive power.
Key words: Self-excited Hawkes process, renormalized memory kernel, anomalous
scaling, social epidemics.
